# Webex-download
Java program used to download videos from webex.

Requires csv file that contains each users firstname, lastname, email.

Admin name, email, and password are hardcoded. URL is hardcoded. Destination of files is hardcoded. 
Everything that is hardcode dependent is labeled with a TODO comment.

Dependent on selenium chrome driver.

I used eclispe to do the development and to sort out the dependencies.

Downloads folder should be empty when starting this download.

Meant to run on MAC OSX

NOTE: The Webex website is 'responsive'. You will need to set the maximum resolution for your display for the page to function as the script needs.
